# Salifort motors Data Analysis Project

## **Overview**

This project analyzes sales and operational data for Salimotors, a leading automotive company, to provide insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and operational efficiency. Using Python and data visualization tools, the analysis highlights trends, key performance indicators (KPIs), and actionable recommendations for business optimization.

## **Objectives**

- Evaluate sales performance across regions and product categories.
- Identify trends in customer preferences and purchasing behavior.
- Analyze operational metrics to improve efficiency.
- Provide actionable insights to enhance business strategies.

## **Key Features**

- **Sales Performance Analysis**: Tracks revenue, sales volume, and regional performance.
- **Customer Preference Insights**: Examines purchasing trends across product categories.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Investigates key metrics like inventory turnover and delivery times.
- **Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs to illustrate findings.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: Primary programming language for data analysis.
- **Libraries**:
  - `Pandas` and `NumPy`: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`: For data visualization.
  - `Plotly`: For interactive visualizations.
  - `Jupyter Notebook`: For interactive coding and analysis.

## **Dataset Information**

- The dataset includes:
  - Sales data (revenue, volume, regions, and categories).
  - Customer demographics and preferences.
  - Operational metrics (inventory levels, delivery times).

## **Steps to Reproduce**

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnalyticJosh/Salimotors-.git
   cd Salimotors-
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:

   - Ensure Python (3.7 or higher) is installed.
   - Install required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run the Notebook**:

   - Open `Salifort Motors Project Lab.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Execute cells sequentially to preprocess data, analyze trends, and generate insights.

## **Sample Analysis**

### Regional Sales Performance

```python
import seaborn as sns
sns.barplot(x='Region', y='Revenue', data=sales_data)
plt.title('Sales Performance by Region')
plt.show()
```

### Customer Preferences Analysis

```python
popular_products = sales_data.groupby('Product')['SalesVolume'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(10)
popular_products.plot(kind='bar', title='Top 10 Products by Sales Volume')
plt.show()
```

## **Results and Insights**

- Key findings:
  - Region A leads in total revenue, contributing 35% of overall sales.
  - SUVs are the most popular product category, accounting for 40% of sales volume.
  - Delivery delays in Region B impacted customer satisfaction, requiring operational adjustments.
- Suggested strategies:
  - Focus marketing efforts on Region A to leverage high revenue potential.
  - Optimize inventory for SUVs to meet demand efficiently.
  - Implement operational improvements to address delivery issues in Region B.

## **Visualizations**

- **Regional Sales Performance**: Bar chart comparing revenue across regions.
- **Product Popularity**: Bar chart of top-selling products.
- **Operational Metrics**: Line chart of delivery times over time.
